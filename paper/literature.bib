In this paper, we introduce the Materials Project (www.materialsproject.org), a core program of the Materials Genome Initiative that uses high-throughput computing to uncover the properties of all known inorganic materials. This open dataset can be accessed through multiple channels for both interactive exploration and data mining. The Materials Project also seeks to create open-source platforms for developing robust, sophisticated materials analyses. Future efforts will enable users to perform ‘‘rapid-prototyping’’ of new materials in silico, and provide researchers with new avenues for cost-effective, data-driven materials design.},

	abstract = {Accurate and fast prediction of materials properties is central to the digital transformation of materials design. However, the vast design space and diverse operating conditions pose significant challenges for accurately modeling arbitrary material candidates and forecasting their properties. We present MatterSim, a deep learning model actively learned from large-scale first-principles computations, for efficient atomistic simulations at first-principles level and accurate prediction of broad material properties across the periodic table, spanning temperatures from 0 to 5000 K and pressures up to 1000 GPa. Out-of-the-box, the model serves as a machine learning force field, and shows remarkable capabilities not only in predicting ground-state material structures and energetics, but also in simulating their behavior under realistic temperatures and pressures, signifying an up to ten-fold enhancement in precision compared to the prior best-in-class. This enables MatterSim to compute materials' lattice dynamics, mechanical and thermodynamic properties, and beyond, to an accuracy comparable with first-principles methods. Specifically, MatterSim predicts Gibbs free energies for a wide range of inorganic solids with near-first-principles accuracy and achieves a 15 meV/atom resolution for temperatures up to 1000K compared with experiments. This opens an opportunity to predict experimental phase diagrams of materials at minimal computational cost. Moreover, MatterSim also serves as a platform for continuous learning and customization by integrating domain-specific data. The model can be fine-tuned for atomistic simulations at a desired level of theory or for direct structure-to-property predictions, achieving high data efficiency with a reduction in data requirements by up to 97\%.},

Anharmonicity or disorder are thus the limiting factors for thermal conductivity in crystals or glasses. Hitherto, no transport equation has been able to account for both. Here, we derive such an equation, resulting in a thermal conductivity that reduces to the Peierls and Allen–Feldman limits, respectively, in anharmonic crystals or harmonic glasses, while also covering the intermediate regimes where both effects are relevant. This approach also solves the long-standing problem of accurately predicting the thermal properties of crystals with ultralow or glass-like thermal conductivity, as we show with an application to a thermoelectric material representative of this class.},

We provide an overview of the recent advances in this field from the points of view of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and atomistic simulations. We summarize the underlying basic properties leading to violations of the standard diffusive picture of heat transport and its universal features, with some historical perspective. We complete this scenario by illustrating also the effects of long-range interaction and integrability on non-diffusive transport. Then we discuss how all of these features can be exploited for thermal management, rectification and to improve the efficiency of energy conversion. We conclude with a review on recent achievements in atomistic simulations of anomalous heat transport in single polymers, nanotubes and two-dimensional materials.

	abstract = {Thermal transport in amorphous materials has remained one of the fundamental questions in solid state physics while involving a very large field of applications. Using a heat conduction theory incorporating coherence, we demonstrate that the strong phase correlation between local and non-propagating modes, commonly named diffusons in the terminology of amorphous systems, triggers the conduction of heat. By treating the thermal vibrations as collective excitations, the significant contribution of diffusons, predominantly relying on coherence, further reveals interesting temperature and length dependences of thermal conductivity. The propagation length of diffuson clusters is found to reach the micron, overpassing the one of propagons. The explored wavelike behavior of diffusons uncovers the unsolved physical picture of mode correlation in prevailing models and further provides an interpretation of their ability to transport heat. This work introduces a framework for understanding thermal vibrations and transport in amorphous materials, as well as an unexpected insight into the wave nature of thermal vibrations.},

	abstract = {The efficient and accurate calculation of how ionic quantum and thermal fluctuations impact the free energy of a crystal, its atomic structure, and phonon spectrum is one of the main challenges of solid state physics, especially when strong anharmonicy invalidates any perturbative approach. To tackle this problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) method. This technique rigorously describes the full thermodynamics of crystals accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. The approach requires the evaluation of the Born–Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives with respect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in supercells, which can be provided, for instance, by first principles density-functional-theory codes. The method performs crystal geometry relaxation on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used to determine the phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables the calculation of phase boundaries for both first-order and second-order phase transitions from the Hessian of the free energy. Finally, the code can also compute the anharmonic phonon spectra, including the phonon linewidths, as well as phonon spectral functions. We review the theoretical framework of the SSCHA and its dynamical extension, making particular emphasis on the physical inter pretation of the variables present in the theory that can enlighten the comparison with any other anharmonic theory. A modular and flexible Python environment is used for the implementation, which allows for a clean interaction with other packages. We briefly present a toy-model calculation to illustrate the potential of the code. Several applications of the method in superconducting hydrides, charge-density-wave materials, and thermoelectric compounds are also reviewed.},

Using an approach adapted from electron transport, we demonstrate that Fourier's law and the heat equation do capture ballistic effects, including temperature jumps at ideal contacts, and are thus applicable on all length scales. Local thermal equilibrium is not assumed, because allowing the phonon distribution to be out-of-equilibrium is important for ballistic and quasi-ballistic transport. The key to including the non-equilibrium nature of the phonon population is to apply the proper boundary conditions to the heat equation. Simple analytical solutions are derived, showing that (i) the magnitude of the temperature jumps is simply related to the material properties and (ii) the observation of reduced apparent thermal conductivity physically stems from a reduction in the temperature gradient and not from a reduction in actual thermal conductivity. We demonstrate how our approach, equivalent to Fourier's law, easily reproduces results of the Boltzmann transport equation, in all transport regimes, even when using a full phonon dispersion and mean-free-path distribution.},

	abstract = {Thermal conductivity in dielectric crystals is the result of the relaxation of lattice vibrations described by the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Remarkably, an exact microscopic definition of the heat carriers and their relaxation times is still missing: Phonons, typically regarded as the relevant excitations for thermal transport, cannot be identified as the heat carriers when most scattering events conserve momentum and do not dissipate heat flux. This is the case for two-dimensional or layered materials at room temperature, or three-dimensional crystals at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, we show that the eigenvectors of the scattering matrix in the Boltzmann equation define collective phonon excitations, which are termed here “relaxons”. These excitations have well-defined relaxation times, directly related to heat-flux dissipation, and they provide an exact description of thermal transport as a kinetic theory of the relaxon gas. We show why Matthiessen’s rule is violated, and we construct a procedure for obtaining the mean free paths and relaxation times of the relaxons. These considerations are general and would also apply to other semiclassical transport models, such as the electronic Boltzmann equation. For heat transport, they remain relevant even in conventional crystals like silicon, but they are of the utmost importance in the case of two-dimensional materials, where they can revise, by several orders of magnitude, the relevant time and length scales for thermal transport in the hydrodynamic regime.},

Born's translation and rotation invariance conditions are shown to be satisfied by the microscopic force constants.

Good agreement with experimental data for diamond is found.

We also detail our efficient implementation of the NEP approach in graphics processing units as well as our workflow for the construction of NEP models and demonstrate their application in large-scale atomistic simulations. By comparing to state-of-the-art MLPs, we show that the NEP approach not only achieves above-average accuracy but also is far more computationally efficient. These results demonstrate that the gpumd package is a promising tool for solving challenging problems requiring highly accurate, large-scale atomistic simulations. To enable the construction of MLPs using a minimal training set, we propose an active-learning scheme based on the latent space of a pre-trained NEP model. Finally, we introduce three separate Python packages, viz., gpyumd, calorine, and pynep, that enable the integration of gpumd into Python workflows.},

For multi-component systems, all the radial functions between two atoms are multiplied by some fixed factors that depend on the types of the two atoms only.

Active learning methods have been recently developed to train force fields efficiently and automatically. Among them, Bayesian active learning utilizes principled uncertainty quantification to make data acquisition decisions. In this work, we present a general Bayesian active learning workflow, where the force field is constructed from a sparse Gaussian process regression model based on atomic cluster expansion descriptors. To circumvent the high computational cost of the sparse Gaussian process uncertainty calculation, we formulate a high-performance approximate mapping of the uncertainty and demonstrate a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the autonomous active learning workflow by training a Bayesian force field model for silicon carbide (SiC) polymorphs in only a few days of computer time and show that pressure-induced phase transformations are accurately captured. The resulting model exhibits close agreement with both ab initio calculations and experimental measurements, and outperforms existing empirical models on vibrational and thermal properties. The active learning workflow readily generalizes to a wide range of material systems and accelerates their computational understanding.},

	abstract = {Atomic cluster expansion (ACE) methods provide a systematic way to describe particle local environments of arbitrary body order. For practical applications it is often required that the basis of cluster functions be symmetrized with respect to rotations and permutations. Existing methodologies yield sets of symmetrized functions that are over-complete. These methodologies thus require an additional numerical procedure, such as singular value decomposition (SVD), to eliminate redundant functions. In this work, it is shown that analytical linear relationships for subsets of cluster functions may be derived using recursion and permutation properties of generalized Wigner symbols. From these relationships, subsets (blocks) of cluster functions can be selected such that, within each block, functions are guaranteed to be linearly independent. It is conjectured that this block-wise independent set of permutation-adapted rotation and permutation invariant (PA-RPI) functions forms a complete, independent basis for ACE. Along with the first analytical proofs of block-wise linear dependence of ACE cluster functions and other theoretical arguments, numerical results are offered to demonstrate this. The utility of the method is demonstrated in the development of an ACE interatomic potential for tantalum. Using the new basis functions in combination with Bayesian compressive sensing sparse regression, some high degree descriptors are observed to persist and help achieve high-accuracy models.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a key tool in computational chemistry, physics, and materials science, aiding the understanding of microscopic processes but also guiding the development of novel materials. A MD simulation requires a model for the interatomic interactions. To this end, one traditionally often uses empirical interatomic potentials or force fields, which are fast but inaccurate, or ab-initio methods based on electronic structure theory such as density functional theory, which are accurate but computationally very expensive (Müser et al., 2023). Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have in recent years emerged as an alternative to these approaches, combining the speed of heuristic force fields with the accuracy of ab-initio techniques (Unke et al., 2021). Neuroevolution potentials (NEPs), implemented in the GPUMD package, in particular, are a highly accurate and efficient class of MLIPs (Fan et al., 2021, 2022; Fan, 2022). NEP models have already been used to study a variety of properties in a range of materials, with recent examples including radiation damage in tungsten (Liu et al., 2023), phase transitions (Fransson, Wiktor, et al., 2023) and dynamics of halide perovskites (Fransson, Rosander, et al., 2023) as well as thermal transport in two-dimensional materials (Sha et al., 2023).

Recently, several equivariant message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been shown to outperform models built using other approaches in terms of accuracy. However, most MPNNs suffer from high computational cost and poor scalability. We propose that these limitations arise because MPNNs only pass two-body messages leading to a direct relationship between the number of layers and the expressivity of the network. In this work, we introduce MACE, a new equivariant MPNN model that uses higher body order messages. In particular, we show that using four-body messages reduces the required number of message passing iterations to just two, resulting in a fast and highly parallelizable model, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art accuracy on the rMD17, 3BPA, and AcAc benchmark tasks. We also demonstrate that using higher order messages leads to an improved steepness of the learning curves.},
